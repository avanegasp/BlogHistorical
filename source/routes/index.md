"If the physical body - the brain, is damaged, does this extend to damage to the self?"

This question is at the heart of Netflix's new original documentary film, My Beautiful Broken Brain as we follow Lotje's Sodderland's incredible story of rehabilitation and recovery from a traumatic hemorrhagic stroke. Executive produced by David Lynch.
